# spzoz-pc-setup
Script that installs software, modifies Windows services and applies firewall rules.

It is basicaly a partial fork of Chris Titus Windows 10 Toolbox and things I need for my usecase, feel free to fork or upgrade to your liking.

There is no UI (I plan on adding it), currently you need to run the script from powershell as admin to make it work.
